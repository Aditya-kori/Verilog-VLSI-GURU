	What is synthesis	
	Synthesis is the process of translating Verilog code (or any HDL) into a netlist of gates and flip-flops that can be implemented on a physical chip like an FPGA or ASIC.
	

	10 Synthesizable contructs are
	1. module endmodule
	2. assign
	3. always(@posedge clk)
	4. if else
	5. case statements
	6. reg
	7. wire
	8. Arithmetic operations
	9. concatenation
	10. Bit wise operators

	10 non synthesizable constructs are
	1. initial 
	2. #delay
	3. forever
	4. $display
	5. $monitor
	6. Events
	7. $finish, $stop
	8. repeat

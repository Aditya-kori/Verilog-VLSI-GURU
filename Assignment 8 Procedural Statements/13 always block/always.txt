	Always block
	a. if sensitivity list has posedge or negedge, then use non-blocking assignments
	b.if sensitivity list doesn't have posedge or negedge, then use blocking assignments
	justify these two statements

	a. These constructs represent sequential logic â€” i.e., flip-flops or registers.
	ex. 	always @(posedge clk) begin
		  q <= d;
		end

	b. These represent combinational logic
	ex.	always @(*) begin
  		   y = a & b;
		end

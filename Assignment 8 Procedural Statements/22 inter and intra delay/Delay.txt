	a. What is the difference between inter delay and intra delay statement

	An inter-delay (also known as a regular delay) specifies the delay on the left-hand side of the assignment, meaning the entire statement is executed after the delay. 
	An intra-delay (or delay on the right-hand side) specifies the delay on the right-hand side, meaning the right-hand side expression is evaluated immediately, but the assignment of that value to the left-hand side is delayed. 

	b. Why these concepts are not applicable to RTL design?
	These concepts are not applicable bcoz they are non synthsizable, meaning that they can't be converted as actual hardware.

	d. Write an example of inter delay statement code?
	#5 a=b+c;

	e. Write an example of intra delay statement code?
	a= #5 b;

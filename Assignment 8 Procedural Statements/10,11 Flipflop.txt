10 How many Flipflops does below code infer
reg Q1,Q2,Q3;
always @(posedge clk) begin
Q1 = d; //Q1 gets updated immediately with value of d
Q2 = Q1; //Q2 gets updated immediately with value of Q1(i.e value of d)
Q3 = Q2; //Q3 gets updated immediately with value of Q2 (i.e value of d)
end

	only 1 flipflop is needed

11 How many Flipflops does below code infer
reg Q1,Q2,Q3;
always @(posedge clk) begin
Q1 <= d;
Q2 <= Q1; //will use old value of Q1, not the updated one
Q3 <= Q2; //will use old value of Q2, not the updated one
end

We need 3 flipflops for the above code

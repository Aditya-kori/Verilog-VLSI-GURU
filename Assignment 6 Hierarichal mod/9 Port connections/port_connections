a. Module can have 3 possible port directions 
	i. Input 
	ii. Output 
	iii. Inout 
b. When to declare them as reg and net? 
	i. Any statement inside always or initial block is called as procedural statement 
	ii. All the variables in the LHS of procedural statement must be declared as reg. 
	iii. Any variable that is not a reg, is compulsory net(wire, wand, wor, tri) 1. 95% of cases it is wire 
c. Why gate level implementation of full adder does not require any reg declaration?
	In Gate level modelling the design is implemented using gates, since these are cntinuously driven so we declare them as wire datatype
	
d. Why data flow implementation of full adder does not require any reg declaration?
	In Date flow implementation, the statement is assigned in the continuous procedural way, so we need to declare as wire not as reg

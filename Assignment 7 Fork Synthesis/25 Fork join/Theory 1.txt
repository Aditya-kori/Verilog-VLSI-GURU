25	In the below code, what time will b,c,d will take the values
		initial begin
		#5 c=1;
		#5 b=0;
		#5 d=c;
		end

	The b,c & d take the values at time 10,5 & 15 respectively

26 & 27	How many processes are their in the below code? at what time c,b,d assignment will happen?
		initial begin
		fork
			#5 c=1;
			#5 b=0;
			#5 d=c;
		join
		end

		there are 3 processes, the b,c,d, takes values at time 5 

28	How many processes are their in the below code? at what time c,b,d assignment will happen?
		initial begin
		fork
		begin
			#5 c=1;
			#5 b=0;
			#5 d=c;
		end
		join
		end

		there is one process, The b,c & d take the values at time 10,5 & 15 respectively

29	How many processes are their in the below code? at what time c,b,d assignment will happen?
		initial begin
		fork
		begin
			#5 c=1;
			#5 b=0;
		end
			#5 d=c;
		join
		end

		there are 2 procesess, the c & d takes values at 5, whereas b takes value value at 10

1. What is an array?How to declare an array?
A: Array is a homogenous collection of data variables.
	Syntax: 
			data_type array_name[MSB:LSB];

2. Difference between array and vectors?
A:	Array 
	->Array is a homogenous collection of data variables.
	->Syntax: 
			data_type array_name[MSB:LSB];
			ex: reg a[0:5];
	->In memory array is referred to as Depth.
	
	Vectors
	->Vectors are used to store multiple bits of data.
	->Syntax:
			data_type [MSB:LSB]array_name;
			ex: reg [7:0]a;
	->In memory vector is referred to as Width.

3. What does reg[7:0] data[15:0]represent?
	What is name? //data
	What is the size of the array? //size=16
	How many locations does array has? //16 locations
	How many bits are stored in each location? //8 bits
	How many bits does entire array has? 128 bits

4. What does reg[31:0] data[63:0]represent?
	What is name? //data
	What is the size of the array? //size=64
	How many locations does array has? //64 locations
	How many bits are stored in each location? //32 bits
	How many bits does entire array has? 32*64 bits

5. Declare a array by name "mem" whose size is 512, in which each location can store 16 bits?   // [15:0]mem[511:0];
	Write a logic to assign all the array locations to zero? //[15:0]mem [511:0];
	Write a logic to assign 458th index of mem array with data 16'hFFFF & other locations zero?
	//

7. Write the syntax to declare array of vectors.
A. Syntax: [<vector_size>]<variable_name>[<array_size>]

8. Declare 16KB of memory whose width is 32?
A. reg[31:0]mem[(16*1024*8)-1:0];

9. Declare a byte addressed memory for 1kB size
A. [7:0]reg mem[(1024*8)-1:0];
